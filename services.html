                <h3>CAPTURING CONTEXT THROUGH UAVs</h3><hr>
                <p style="font-weight: lighter;">Every few years, the geospatial industry undergoes a revolution. First, it was total stations, then came GPS, laser scanners and robotics. Now, professionals are adding another tool, surveying drones, which boast quick data collection. Drones mean a quantum leap for surveying.

                  They provide eyes that can reach and hover above specific sites. Their height and cameras can be adjusted remotely. And, equipped with sensors, they can measure, transmit and store data. We are using this technology in the areas of engineering surveys, construction monitoring and traffic management.</p> </div>

                    <h3>VR STUDIO NEPAL</h3><hr>
                    <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The use of virtual reality (VR) in civil engineering may seem like a strange concept, but it promises to have some unexpected benefits. We are using this technology for use in the design and review process. Survey data is processed and digitised to build a 3D model. Building a construction project in a virtual environment offers many key benefits. One of the most obvious of these is having the ability to test a number of factors without the time and cost of building the structure, reducing the number of errors present in the completed project.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: lighter;">Under our umbrella, Nepal’s first VR Studio with state-of-the-art equipment has been established.</p>

                <h3>BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING</h3><hr>
                <p style="font-weight: lighter;">Welcome to digital construction.
                  We invite you to make the jump from CAD to BIM. We provide BIM (Building Information Modelling) solutions for all industry players: owners and governments, construction and management, architects and engineers, consultants and specialized contractors.
                  Our goal is to help our clients design and build better projects, reducing time and costs, by applying the full potential of BIM.<br> 
                  
                  The benefits for DE and BIM include:<br>
                  1. The ability to create 3D models that enhance the analysis of geotechnical elements, help in clash and issues resolution, enable the development of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) solutions<br>
                  2. Supports the creation of a value chain that is connected, collaborative and efficient. This would contribute to improvements in performance.<br>
                  3. Allowing for one source of truth in a federated model between all key players before, during and after the asset creation process.<br>
                  4. The 3D and 4D designs help in constructability reviews.<br>
                  5. Improving visualisation and stakeholder engagement.<br>
                  6. Creating a foundation for a digital twin. A digital twin is a dynamic digital representation of a real asset or system that is used to collect, understand, predict and optimise performance.</p>
